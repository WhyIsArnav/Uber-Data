## Overview:
This project looks at Uber data at a certain location and tries to analyze various insights and questions related to the dataset like trips by the hour, Trips by Hour and Month, Trips Every Hour, trips by Day and Month, Trips by Bases and Month, and various heatmaps. 

## Directory ðŸ“–
The columns that were used are: 
- Lat
- Long
- Base
- Date
- Time
- Month
- Day
- Year
- Hour
- Minute
- Day of week 

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹

**1. Put all csv file into one single dataframe**

```r

df1 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-apr14.csv")
df2 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-may14.csv")
df3 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-jun14.csv")
df4 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-jul14.csv")
df5 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-aug14.csv")
df6 <- read.csv("uber-raw-data-sep14.csv")

uber <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6)
```

**2. Fix the date and time format and use the mutate function**

```r
uber$Date.Time <- as.POSIXct(strptime(uber$Date.Time, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"))
uber$Date <- as.Date(uber$Date.Time)
uber$Time <- format(uber$Date.Time, "%H:%M:%S")

uber <- uber %>%
  mutate(Month = format(Date.Time, "%m"),
         Day = format(Date.Time, "%d"),
         Year = format(Date.Time, "%Y"),
         Hour = format(Date.Time, "%H"),
         Minute = format(Date.Time, "%M"))

uber$Month <- as.numeric(uber$Month)
uber$Day <- as.numeric(uber$Day)
uber$Year <- as.numeric(uber$Year)
uber$Hour <- as.numeric(uber$Hour)
uber$Minute <- as.numeric(uber$Minute)
```

## Data analysis 
**1. Making pivot table for trips by hour and graph**
```r
trips_by_hour <- uber %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Hour)

trips_by_hour_graph <- ggplot(trips_by_hour, aes(x = Hour, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Uber Trips by Hour", x = "Hour of the Day", y = "Number of Trips") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, by = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # Use comma function to format y-axis labels with commas
  theme_minimal()
```

**2. Making pivot table for trips by hour each month and graph**
```r
trips_by_month_hour <- uber %>%
  group_by(Month, Hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Month, Hour)

trips_by_month_hour_graph <- ggplot(trips_by_month_hour, aes(x = Hour, y = Count, fill = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.name))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Uber Trips by Hour and Month", x = "Hour of the Day", y = "Number of Trips", fill = "Month") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, by = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +  
  theme_minimal()
```

**3. Making pivot table for trips each day and graph**
```r
trips_by_day <- uber %>%
  group_by(Day) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Day)

trips_by_day_graph <- ggplot(trips_by_day, aes(x = Day, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Uber Trips by Day of the Month", x = "Day of the Month", y = "Number of Trips") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(trips_by_day$Day)) +  # Set breaks based on unique days in the dataset
  theme_minimal()
```

**4. Making pivot table for trips each day during the month and graph**

```r
trips_by_month_day <- uber %>%
  group_by(Month, Day, Weekday = weekdays(Date)) %>%
  summarise(Trip_Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Month, Day) 

trips_by_month_day_graph <- ggplot(trips_by_month_day, aes(x = Weekday, y = Trip_Count, fill = factor(Month))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Day of the Week", y = "Number of Trips", fill = "Month") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month", labels = c("Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep")) +  # Customize month labels
  theme_minimal() +  # Optional: Use a minimal theme
  ggtitle("Number of Uber Trips by Month and Day of the Week") 

```

**5. Making pivot table for trips each month by base and graph**

```r
trips_by_base_month <- uber %>%
  group_by(Base, Month) %>%
  summarise(Trip_Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Month, Base) 

trips_by_base_month_graph <- ggplot(trips_by_base_month, aes(x = Base, y = Trip_Count, fill = factor(Month))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Base", y = "Number of Trips", fill = "Month") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month", labels = c("Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep")) +  
  theme_minimal() +  
  ggtitle("Number of Uber Trips by Base and Month") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) 
```

**6. Making heatmap for trips by base**

```r
uber$DayOfWeek <- weekdays(uber$Date)
heatmap_data <- table(uber$Base, uber$DayOfWeek)
heatmap_data <- as.data.frame(heatmap_data)
colnames(heatmap_data) <- c("Base", "DayOfWeek", "Count")
heatmap_data$DayOfWeek <- factor(heatmap_data$DayOfWeek, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

trips_by_bases_week_heatmap <- ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = DayOfWeek, y = Base, fill = Count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkorange", high = "darkblue") +  # Custom color gradient
  labs(x = "Day of Week", y = "Base", title = "Uber Trips by Base and Day of Week") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


**7. Making heatmap for month and base**


```r
trips_by_month_day <- uber %>%
  group_by(Month = format(Date.Time, "%m"),  # Extract month as two-digit numeric format
           Day = as.integer(format(Date.Time, "%d"))) %>%  # Extract day of the month as integer
  summarise(Trip_Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

trips_by_month_day_heatmap <- ggplot(trips_by_month_day, aes(x = Day, y = Month, fill = Trip_Count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Day of Month", y = "Month", fill = "Number of Trips") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Uber Trips Heatmap by Month and Day")
```

**8. Making meat map for trip by hour**

```r
trips_by_hour_day <- uber %>%
  group_by(Day = as.integer(format(Date.Time, "%d")),  # Extract day of the month as integer
           Hour = as.numeric(format(Date.Time, "%H"))) %>%  # Extract hour as numeric
  summarise(Trip_Count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

trips_by_hour_day_heatmap <- ggplot(trips_by_hour_day, aes(x = Day, y = Hour, fill = Trip_Count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") +  # Use red and green color gradient
  labs(x = "Day of Month", y = "Hour of Day", fill = "Number of Trips") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Uber Trips Heatmap by Hour and Day of Month")
```


**9. Making geospatial heatmap **

```r
heatmap_data <- uber %>%
  group_by(Lat, Lon, Hour) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

geospatial_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addHeatmap(
    data = heatmap_data,
    lng = ~Lon, 
    lat = ~Lat,  
    intensity = ~Count, 
    blur = 20,    
    radius = 15,
    minOpacity = 0.1,  
    max = max(heatmap_data$Count)  
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    position = "bottomright",  
    pal = colorNumeric(palette = "viridis", domain = heatmap_data$Count),  
    values = heatmap_data$Count,  
    title = "Number of Trips"  
  )

```
